CST 466 HW1 Specifications

1.

Specifications:
	Input file must be in plain-text ascii. Binary documents(Word, Excel, etc) will be rejected.
	Only alphabetic symbols will be accepted. Uppercase and lowercase plain-text will be accepted. Punctuation, spaces, and special characters will be ignored.
	All alphabetic symbols will be converted to lowercase for decryption.
	All alphabetic symbols will be converted to uppercase for encryption.
	When decrypting a cipher-text file, an output plain-text file will automatically be created with the same name as the input file, but with the text "Decrypt" prefixed. Thus, an input cipher file of test.txt will be decrypted and saved as Decrypt test.txt
	When encrypting a plain-text file, an output cipher-text file will automatically be created with the same name as the input file, but with the text "Encrypt" prefixed. Thus, an input plain-text file of test.txt will be encrypted and saved as Encrypt test.txt
	Must be able to be used from the command line.
	

	
3.) Cryptoanalysis

How to determine if file is plain-text or binary? We could go byte byte to check the range of the characters.
	If a byte is outside of the range of ascii, then we know it's not a plain-text file.
	
	


Limitations:
	Only Caesar Cyphered text can be analysed.
	Only lower-case cypher-text can be analysed.
